<h1>About my Project</h1>

<p>I will be doing a project for developing a game using the Unity program, it will be a fantasy game that tells a story as you go through it and hopefully incorporate some learning into the game as well.</p>
<p>It will be a journey to save your village from a zombie plague, you will be able to play as 4 different characters with different abilities and you will have to try use strategy and use the team to progress through the story.</p>
<p>I would also like to make it a play with friends’ multiplayer game where you have to work together to get through quests and trying to stray from the group has consequences. I would also like to add consequences to the story in solo and multiplayer and the story progress by those choices as well.</p>

<h2>What it will teach</h2>

<p>I am hoping that this will teach sharing and working together as a group in multiplayer, I also hope it will teach that with every action it has a consequence whether it be good or bad.</p> 
<p>My motivation for this is I like to play games and some games are more fun playing with friends. </p>
<p>I am also getting motivation with the types of games I enjoy playing with choices and the story progress with those choices.</p>
<p>I also wanted to bring a game where it was just as fun to play solo when you are unable to tee up time with friends. </p>

<h3>My Game Idea</h3>

<p>My game idea is you start off in Australia and a portal appears near you with a voice asking for help. This will be the first choice with the game having an ending if you don’t choose to enter the portal. After entering the portal, you will be prompted to customise a character with different fantasy characters with unique abilities and a range of look.</p>
<p>Then the character will meet the person who was calling out for help with 3 other people behind them and the story will begin. As you progress through the game you will meet NPC’s that you can become friends or enemies with depending on choices you make with them. This will be the same with the 4 starting people as well, which will affect the ending of the game. I want to have more than one ending and a way to come back and try for the other endings. I would like to add little mini games where you solve puzzles to gain secrets and lore of the fantasy world. I want to make it interactive so you get lost in the game. </p>
<p>I want to make the game so you can switch between third person or first person, I also would put in a lot of weapon types and make it so you can also easily switch between the different types. I would like to bring the game to all consoles and PC so everyone has access to the game. I want to make the game with a base story but it changes as the person progress so it is like the person is the one creating the story as they play the game. I will also try to put in that the person can choose to have a relationship which will be affected if they choose to stay in the fantasy world or go back to their own world. </p>
<p>The save features will be auto save and manual save option. There will also be a choice that you don’t have to fight everything you come across. The skills will be designed around how the game is played and will same with the other playable characters, they will also have their own skills which can be affected by the choice of the player.</p>
<p>The inventory space will be limited but will be upgraded as they progress through. There will also be an option to have a pet that will follow you around and also help with tasks, some of the pets will also have different functions and accessing certain places. For the PC version will make sure that it has controller support. </p>

<h4>Tools Needed</h4>

<p>The tools needed will be the Unity software to make the game. A laptop or PC to use Unity software and to test the game is playable. The hardware that is also needed is a controller for the PC plus consoles, mouse, keyboard, console systems. When making the game will need to make sure that it can run with the specifications of the consoles and computer.</p>
<p>Will also need drawing software, writing software, a drawing tablet or iPad, a digital pen for the tablet and iPad. Internet connection to do updates or run the software that is internet based. Internet browser to use to search code or help when stuck. Utilising cloud base services so you can switch between laptop and desktop.</p>

<h5>Skill Needed</h5>

<p>Some of the skill needed will be the code Unity uses to create games, drawing skills for designing characters and landscape, creative writing for creating the story, characters. Identifying the specifications of the different PC and consoles.</p>
<p>To find these can search through google, Udemy has some good courses that cover a huge range of drawing, writing and code. Going onto a store website will help with the specifications for the consoles and PC.</p>
<p>Can search google for the Unity download to get the application onto the computer that is being used. Also need to make sure that cloud services are enabled so you can pick up your work wherever. Another good thing is to get a wi-fi dongle or hotspot from a mobile phone. </p>

<h6>A Successful Project</h6>

<p>If the project is successful will have a fully developed game with really good graphics and smooth gameplay. I’m hoping the development is that it will bring joy and plenty of hours of gameplay, also will hopefully will teach that actions will have consequences.</p>
<p>I am also hoping it will teach how to think out of the box for solutions and not look for an easy way around things. I also hope this will inspire people to follow their dreams and to do things they love doing.</p>
