<h1>Results of three Personality Tests</h1>

<p>I took three tests online which were Myers-Briggs test, Vark Learning Test and Creative Test.</p>

<h2>Results of the Myers-Briggs Test</h2>

<p>Mediator: poetic, kind, altruistic and eager to help a good cause</p> 

<p>Mind: 27% - Extraverted and 73% Introverted – prefer fewer, deep, meaningful social interactions and feel drawn to calmer environments</p>

<p>Energy: 69% Intuitive and 31% Observant – imaginative, open-minded, curious, value originality, focus on hidden meanings and distant possibilities</p>

<p>Nature: 34% Thinking and 66% Feeling – value emotional expression, sensitivity, lot of importance on empathy, social harmony and cooperation</p>

<p>Tactics: 35% Judging and 65% Prospecting – very good at improvising, adapting to opportunities, flexible nonconformists who value novelty above stability</p>

<p>Identity – 22% Assertive and 78% Turbulent – self-conscious and sensitive to stress, feel a sense of urgency in emotions and tend to be success-driven, perfectionistic and eager to improve</p>

<h3>Vark Learning Test</h3>

<p>Multimodal – prefer different formats like graphs, diagrams, maps, interesting layouts, space, listening, discussing, talking, questioning, notes, handouts, print, text, practical exercises, experiences, examples, case studies, trail, error and things that are real</p>

<p>Scores</p>

<p>Visual – 6</p>

<p>Aural – 6</p>

<p>Read/write – 10</p>

<p>Kinesthetic – 14</p>

<h4>Creative Test</h4>

<p>Creative Type – The Dreamer</p>

<p>Creative Strengths: connection to emotions and imagination, empathy and sensitivity</p>

<p>Untapped potential: Using dreams to fuel real world action</p>

<p>Ideal Collaborator: the innovator</p>

<h5>What the reults meant to me</h5>

<p>The results of the tests mean to me is that I am creative type thinker and I need to be able to interact to help with my learning style. This will affect me as I don’t like to take charge, I prefer to follow and take instructions. I would consider that I am shy and consider what I am assigned to do and make sure I do it without letting my team down.</p>
