<p>Jamie Virgen â€“ S3987693
S3987693@student.rmit.edu.au
I was born in Darwin, Australia where I still live. I speak English and learning how to speak Japanese. I graduated high school in 2009 and I do some small classes for drawing, and creative writing with Udemy. A enjoy a lot of different hobbies like playing games, reading, writing and drawing.</p>

<h2>My Interest in IT</h2>

<p>My interest in IT started in my last two years of Primary School which were full computer classes where I learned about computer systems, how they work and html in notepad to create websites. I really enjoy writing programs in creating applications and games, watching code being written and then how it displays and goes together.</p>

<h3>Person who sparked my Interest</h3>

<p>The person who sparked my first interest in IT was my Primary School teacher but unfortunately there was many computer classes to choose from who had teachers that knew what they were doing and made IT fun. I got sparked again when I met my partner who had study IT and helped me build my own PC. I also got a job at Kinetic IT doing basic troubleshooting which sparked my love IT again.</p>

<h4>Reson for studying at RMIT</h4>

<p>I chose to study with RMIT cause it fit with my schedule of studying online so I could still work full time. Also RMIT was really helpful when I was enquire and instead of doing the bachelor they let me do the two courses of introduction to IT and introduction to programming to leave my options open in case I wanted to go into a different degree connected to these classes.</p>

<h5>What I expect to Learn</h5>

<p>I expect to learn more about IT systems and how they interact with each other, I would also like to learn more about programming to expand my knowledge to make games and make a better creative writing app which are two hobbies that I use to unwind and I think it will be cool to see them come to life from learning through classes that I enjoyable and interesting.</p>
